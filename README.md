# No Nonsense Notes for SAP (NNN)

The fastest way to browse SAP Notes and Knowledge Base Articles.

Welcome to my vibe coding project with purpose! This is a Chrome Extension that makes "life with SAP" just a tiny bit better. Over the course of your career, No Nonsense Notes will save you many seconds that you should spend offline with friends and family.

Enjoy,

Marc
